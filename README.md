# ConVec: Vector Embedding of Wikipedia Concepts and Entities

WikipediaParser folder contains the code to extract and prepare the Wikipedia dump.

Please find in the following, link the pre-traind Concept, Word and Entitie vectors (as a result of this project): 
- The Wikipedia ID to Title map file (This file maps the Wikipedia ID of a page to its title): https://web.cs.dal.ca/~sherkat/Files/ID_title_map.zip (210MB)

- Traind Concepts, Entities and Words: Concepts and entities are presented by their Wikipedia ID.
 - ConVec https://web.cs.dal.ca/~sherkat/Files/WikipediaClean5Negative300Skip10.zip (3.3GB)
